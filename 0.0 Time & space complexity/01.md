what is time complexity?
Time complexity is a measure of the number of operations a program takes to run. It is usually expressed as a function of the input 

# Rules
1. measure in worst scenario.
2. ignore constant factors.
3. avoid lower value .
# Notation
big oh notation (upper bound )
omega (lower bound)

Q1 . ans => 0(n^2)
Q2. ans => o(n^2/2)


# space
Auxillary spcae and input sace = space complexity




server taking the time 
1s = 10^8
2s =2x 10^8
3s = 3x 10^8
