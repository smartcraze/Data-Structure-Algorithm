# Recursion
when function calles itself

### Stackoverflow 
when the recursion overflow beacause of the base case and it runs for the loop when it runs out the memory this is knows as 

# base condition
stop condtion 
# stack space 
# Recuesion tree


# backtraking 
make sure that the recursive function run the last call and come backwards
check one.cpp backcount function and also the the print function is written after the recursive function call so that it doesnot run in the starts
